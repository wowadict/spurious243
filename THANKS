The THANKS file:

All distributions should contain a `THANKS' file containing a two column list
of the contributors, one per line, alphabetically sorted. The left column gives
the contributor's name, while the right column gives the last known good email
address for this contributor. This list should be introduced with a wording
similar to this one:

 MaNGOSVB THANKS file

 MaNGOSVB is based on Spurious written by the Spurious Team but the project has
 been inactive for many years. To them, we are eternally grateful.
 
 In June 2013 the MaNGOS team decided to bring it into the MaNGOS family and try
 and help progress it by reusing some of the technical knowledge and expertise
 that the MaNGOS team already had.
