- IrcClient.AutoAwaySync, query every minute WHO of joined channels to keep away synced
- Reconnect() / StoreRejoinChannels() should remember channel keys too!
- add IrcNetwork property, which is guessed by default or passed with Connect()
- Documentation
- passive channel sync
- AutoNickChange
- clean message parser, channel is not always right set (need to check for replycode!)
- DCC chat, file send/receive
- ipv6 support?
- add IrcConnection.HostAddress (which IP is used for the client)
- add OnSocketTimeout event
- add server properties to IrcConnection (required for smart mode changes etc)
- Exception Error Handling (argument checking)
- Use async sockets?
- Create Debian Package
